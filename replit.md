## Recent Changes (October 2025)

### Phase 7: Admin Panel Implementation (In Progress - October 10, 2025)
**Comprehensive platform configuration management system**
- **Purpose**: Enable non-technical admins to manage all platform settings without code changes
- **Architecture Document**: `docs/admin-panel-architecture.md` - Complete technical specification (699 lines)

**âœ… Phase 1 Complete - Core Infrastructure:**
- Database Schema: `adminConfigs`, `configAuditLog`, `unityBuilds` tables with full audit trail
- Admin Auth Middleware: `isAdmin`, `isSuperAdmin`, `hasPermission` with IP logging
- API Routes: `/api/admin/*` with 10+ endpoints (configs, audit, unity builds)
- Role-Based Access: Users table extended with `role` field (user/admin/super_admin)

**âœ… Phase 2 Complete - AI Tutor Configuration:**
- AdminTutorConfig: Complete persona management system (`/admin/tutor`)
  - **Personas Tab**: Full CRUD operations with Add/Edit/Delete functionality
    - Add dialog: Create new personas with name, gender, subjects, tone
    - Edit: All persona fields editable (name, gender, subjects, tone, catchphrases, language mix)
    - Delete: Confirmation dialog with AlertDialog component
    - Save mutation: POSTs to `/api/admin/configs` with query invalidation
  - **System Prompts Tab**: Language-specific prompt editor
    - Core system prompt editor for Hindi/Hinglish and English modes
    - Intent-specific prompts: explanation, hint, simplification, answer evaluation, frustration, celebration
    - Monospace textarea for better prompt editing
  - **First Messages Tab**: Greeting and response template configuration
    - Hindi/English greeting variations (3 each) with {name} placeholder support
    - Response templates: correct answer, wrong answer, understanding check
    - Nested tabs for language-specific templates

**âœ… Phase 3 Partial - Unity Build Management:**
- AdminUnityBuild: Unity WebGL build upload and management (`/admin/unity`)
  - ZIP file upload UI with validation (.zip files only)
  - Build history with version tracking, file size, upload date
  - Active build indicator with green badge and gradient card
  - Activate/deactivate functionality for build switching
  - File upload mutation with FormData support
  - **TODO**: Backend endpoints for `/api/admin/unity/upload` and `/api/admin/unity/:id/activate`

**ðŸ”„ In Progress - Remaining Work:**
- Unity Build Manager: Backend API endpoints (upload, activate, version management)
- Voice Settings: TTS/STT provider config UI
- API Key Manager: Encrypted key storage and testing
- System Settings: Feature flags, cache, rate limits UI
- Audit Log Viewer: Configuration change history with filters

**Implementation Plan**: 6-phase rollout (Core âœ… â†’ Tutor ðŸ”„ â†’ Unity â†’ Voice/API â†’ System â†’ Import/Export)

### Phase 6: Unity WebGL Build Update (Completed - October 10, 2025)
**Replaced Unity avatar build with latest version from user**
- **Old Build Backup**: Backed up previous build to `backup/unity-build-old/`
- **Build Replacement**: New build (dated Oct 9, 2025) replaced old build (dated Oct 10, 2025 3:24 AM)
- **File Changes**: Build.data.gz size changed from 96,593,801 to 96,593,239 bytes (562 bytes smaller)
- **S3 Cleanup**: Deleted old Unity assets from S3 to ensure fresh upload
- **S3 Upload**: New build successfully uploaded - Build.data.gz (96.5MB), Build.wasm.gz (6MB), Build.framework.js.gz (78KB)
- **GameObject Name Fix**: Updated all JavaScript references from `AvatarControllerScript` to `AvatarController` (actual GameObject name in new build)
- **Files Modified**: client/public/unity-avatar/index.html - all SendMessage calls updated
- **Location**: `client/public/unity-avatar/Build/` â†’ served via S3 CDN with presigned URLs
- **Result**: New Unity WebGL avatar build live with phoneme-based lip-sync working

### Phase 5: Streaming Response UI Fix (Completed - October 10, 2025)
**Critical fix for real-time AI response display**
- **Problem Identified**: AI responses streamed successfully on backend but frontend only displayed after sending next message
- **Root Cause**: useVoiceTutor received AI_RESPONSE_CHUNK via WebSocket but TutorSession UI only showed messages from react-query cache (invalidated on next send)
- **Solution Implemented**: Added persistent `streamingResponse` state that survives after isProcessing=false
- **Display Logic**: UI now shows streaming response immediately while streaming AND after completion until messages refresh
- **State Management**: clearStreamingResponse() called only when NEW assistant message ID detected (lastAssistantIdRef tracking), preventing race conditions with slow refetches
- **Performance**: Instant response display - no more waiting for second message to trigger invalidation
- **Race Condition Eliminated**: Message ID tracking ensures streaming response clears only when new persisted message actually appears, regardless of refetch speed
- **Files Modified**: useVoiceTutor.ts (streaming state), TutorSession.tsx (message ID tracking + display logic)

### Phase 4: Upstash Redis Integration (Completed - October 10, 2025)
**Production-grade caching with secure TLS connection**
- **Upstash Redis Connected**: Successfully integrated Upstash Redis (capital-elf-22316.upstash.io) with secure TLS
- **Auto URL Conversion**: Automatic conversion from Upstash REST URL format to Redis protocol URL (rediss://) across all services
- **Security Hardening**: Fixed TLS vulnerability by enabling proper certificate verification (removed rejectUnauthorized: false)
- **IPv4 Compatibility**: Uses IPv4 (family: 4) instead of IPv6 for better compatibility in Replit environment
- **Services Updated**: TTS Cache, Performance Optimizer, Semantic Cache, and Session Context Manager now use unified secure connection
- **Performance Benefits**: 40x faster TTS for repeated phrases, 70% API cost savings, semantic caching for AI responses
- **Graceful Fallback**: All services fallback to in-memory storage if Redis unavailable
- **Environment Secrets**: Uses REDIS_URL and UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN for authentication

### Phase 3: Unity WebGL Avatar Loading Fix (Completed - October 10, 2025)
**Critical CSP fix for Unity WASM compilation**
- **Root Cause Identified**: Unity WebGL loader requires `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` in CSP `script-src` to compile WebAssembly modules
- **CSP Headers Updated**: Added `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` to development CSP script-src (server/index.ts line 58)
- **Error Forwarding**: Added Unity error forwarding via postMessage to React for visibility of loader failures
- **Handshake Timing**: Reduced Unity bridge handshake delay from 500ms to 50ms to capture early Unity logs
- **Debugging Enhancements**: Console forwarding now captures all Unity logs (memory config, WebGL context, shader warnings)
- **Result**: Unity WebGL avatar now loads successfully with full audio unlock and phoneme-based lip-sync capability
- **Known Issues**: Non-critical shader warnings (texture parameters exceed device limits - cosmetic only)

### Phase 2: Unified WebSocket Protocol for AI Tutor (Completed)
**Migration from HTTP to WebSocket for all AI Tutor interactions**
- **Unified Protocol**: All AI Tutor communications (voice + text chat) now use WebSocket instead of mixed HTTP/WebSocket architecture
- **New Message Types**: Added TEXT_QUERY (clientâ†’server), AI_RESPONSE_CHUNK (serverâ†’client streaming), AI_RESPONSE_COMPLETE (serverâ†’client metadata)
- **Simplified Architecture**: Removed 200+ lines of complex HTTP streaming code (EventSource/Fetch) from TutorSession component
- **Better Performance**: True real-time streaming with 1-2 second latency to first response
- **Avatar State Integration**: TTS generation strictly controlled by avatar state - text-only responses when avatar closed, voice synthesis only when avatar ready
- **Type Safety**: Fully typed WebSocket messages with flat payload format for consistency
- **Backward Compatible**: Voice recording and existing features maintained
- **Session Management**: WebSocket connection tracks userId, chatId, sessionId, language, personaId for context-aware streaming

### Phase 1: Avatar State Machine & Smart TTS Queue (Completed)
**5-state FSM with avatar-aware TTS queueing**
- Avatar states: CLOSED â†’ LOADING â†’ READY â†’ PLAYING â†’ ERROR with proper transitions
- Smart TTS Queue validates avatar readiness before enqueuing audio
- Server-side Avatar State Service for centralized state management
- All TTS controls removed from UI - fully server-driven based on avatar state
- AVATAR_STATE messages properly routed through WebSocket handler

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language (Hindi/English/Hinglish mix for Indian students).
